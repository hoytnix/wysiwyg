[] Dev: Feed to check for updates to librarys' docs/changes.
[] Feature: wp-import => web-import:
    + Search Engine (Spidey) => AI
    + Rebuild static or mostly-static web-pages.
    + Auto-contact owners with preposed improvements.
    + Seemlesly re-build existing apps.

Re-engineer "Spidey" to archive, index, and analyze various web-applications:
    + CMS
        + Blog
    + E-Commerce
    + BBS
        + Craigslist
        + Forum
        + Stackoverflow
    + Support
        + FAQ
        + Issues
        + CRM
        + SMM
    + Wiki

Websites should be able to be rebuilt at least visually through translating raw-HTML to data-fixtures that fit the Anavah engine. 
Specific functionality can be built for the most-valuable applications.
It should be important to notice the difference between Disqus, Craigslist, and Stackoverflow. 
Contact information should be available to approach the owner, or otherwise it should be possible to estimate an intrinsic value in case of manually searching.
Engine filters should be in place to filter out spam, bad words, negative content, etc.
Static-websites are gold because they can be easily rebuilt, offer massive improvements for a lower cost, and include the ability to update information from the control-panel/UI with a renewed, modernism.



AI EXAMPLE

Black Wheel           <- Title: largest text, first.
"It's a black wheel." <- Description: quotes.
$29.95                <- Price: ([0] in ($,...)
(25 / 3)              <- Variable/unit-price: prob. comes after "Price"



Pricing for a dedicated server should be assesed after the engine in assembled.
The engine need not be assembled until HTML can finally be translated to-and-from fixtures.
The engine needs a useable, binary-compiled, indexable, file-system. (Spidey issue.)
    In fact, go make issues for Spidey and fix them in this update!
The engine should run on its own with only initial input, until a specifed parameter is met, probably disk-space of quantity.
Don't go for the sensitive information like contacts until later, don't need to be banned, do that when the data is actually VALUABLE and TARGETED.
    This should be FEW and FAR BETWEEN!


Filters:
[ ] Bad-words
[ ] Countries
[ ] Word-frequency
[ ]   Articles
[ ]   Links
[ ]   Matches in index
[ ]   Sub-domains

Filters as well as categorization of websites based on word occurences can be assembled from information already embedded into Spidey comments/program.



INTRINSIC VALUE

Can be estimated by taking compiled HTML size, calculating the product of the AWS-request-cost and number of requests; and comparing it to the customer's current pricing.

Customer's pricing can be found as follows:
[ ] Compile a list of hosting providers and their hostnames
[ ] Scrape their pricing tiers
[ ] Check website owner's whois for host, and index its price.
[ ] Since utility is multitudes less expensive, use the lowest-tier, so customers who are paying more than that will have the added drama of "Oh we can actually save you 5000% then."

Compile the index of websites and their values into a sortable table for telemarketing, by me.



SSL

DNS for a multi-site network like this should be tricky but is required anyways.
Offer a free-SSL option, with whatever extra-costs not up-charged.
    Has to be a dedicated-IP.
Offer option of a dedicated IP for self-SSL.
    May up-charge for the IP.
Provide a platform for users to purchase SSL/DNS-support without human interaction:
    + Ordering without humans leaves no error for mistakes, pre-preperation, presentation, etc. (Think Google.)
    + Walk them through variables which effect pricing, and/or allow us to prepare.
    + Intelligently use information compiled on their providers:
        + Scrape images, info, etc.
        + Depending on if they use mail or not, just chaging a name-server may not cut it: do your research!
Support fees will probably be a major financial source for the initial development:
    + Small-static websites may be drastically less-expensive on the Anavah platform,
        however, their value is also correlated to that low traffic so we don't make much.
    + Live support will be a gateway to connecting with customers and building rapport;
    + Rapport will be used to offer upgrades, future proposals (like the release schedule price changes), etc.
It may be beneficial to partner with a provider such as Namecheap.
